Thank you for the update. 

In regards to your question, either way works to store your graph. Adjacency matrix may take more memory, but it will be fine for this application, especially since your largest dataset is only 250x250. Choose whichever you like -- an adjacency matrix may be simpler for this assignment. In real world applications, the decision would be made looking at the runtime and memory consumption of both implementations.

Please also make sure to schedule your mid project meeting soon. Let us know if you have any other questions!
