## Week 1: 11/06 - 11/12

There was no dev log for this week. Please make to complete the rest of the dev logs to get full points in this section. 

## Week 2: 11/13 - 11/26

Thank you for the update. 

In regards to your question, either way works to store your graph. Adjacency matrix may take more memory, but it will be fine for this application, especially since your largest dataset is only 250x250. Choose whichever you like -- an adjacency matrix may be simpler for this assignment. In real world applications, the decision would be made looking at the runtime and memory consumption of both implementations.

Please also make sure to schedule your mid project meeting soon. Let us know if you have any other questions!

Hi team! To complete the project, I would focus on **implementing** code and ensuring that you pass your test cases. Then, if for some reason there is unwanted behavior, add a test case to address it. Additionally, it may be beneficial to get ahead of the curve for this project to allow some breathing room for other projects/final exams. To this end, I would like to see you guys write out some more goals along with granular explanations and subgoals. 

You can definitely do either representation (I prefer thinking about it as seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVIr8Y5isek&ab_channel=PoloClubofDataScience)), but make a decision and justify it. Usually things come with tradeoffs - discuss these in your final report in terms of time and space complexity.

Lastly, keep documenting your progress and it will be helpful when you go to write the final report!

## Mid Project Meeting

We met for our Mid Project Meeting on 11/28 at 12pm. The team was able to present their algorithm with an explanation of how their tests would prove the algorithm's accuracy. 

We discussed the issue mentioned with the randomness of the random surfer model causing some tests to fail. One solution to this would be having a global epsilon to account for this error, and to mention that there is inherently a difference between the two models for calculating PageRank in your report. 

Overall, great job!

Great job making progress this week.

We discussed the issues encountered in our Mid Project Meeting and it has been summarized above. You both are on track to finish the project. Nice job outlining and finishing goals for this week. 

Let us know if you have any questions as you continue working on the remaining code and report.
