### Goals 
1. Finish function to read in CSV into 2D adjacency matrix (Not completed)

### Tasks Complete
Both kpura3 and hrishis2 were unable to complete this task due to the volume of work they had for their other courses this week, 
yet aim to complete the function by the following week.

### Issues encountered (Questions for mentors)
Is it best to store the adjacency matrix as a 2D array? Would it be better to instead have an edge list, as a large number of pages in the Pagerank algorithm will not be connected?
For example, there are several links with 0s as connections. Would it be best to instead have an edge list, which also then makes the actual algorithm for choosing a random link traversal easier.

### Plans for next week
Conclude whether an edge list or an adjacency matrix is most accurate to the algorithm
Finish the function to read in the CSV
Work towards concluding the pagerank algorithm
